# What it does

This programme will detect distance and sense if something is blocking its way.


# Notes
- The programme defines a constant to detect a block. Here the `C_OBSTACLE` is defined as 5 cm.
- It will `forever` call the `move_away()` to detect if the car is blocked.
- If the car is not blocked, the car will move forward.

- If the car is blocked, 
  - It will first move backward,
  - Next, it will choose from one of four movements defined:
    - Forward to the left or the right,
    - Backward to the left or the right,
    - A random number [0..3] (inclusive) will be picked. The random number will determine the movement to be chosen.
